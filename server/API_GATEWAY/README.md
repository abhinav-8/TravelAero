FRONTEND - MIDDLE-END - BACKEND

- We need an intermediate layer between the client side and microservices
- Using this middle end, when client sends request we will be able to make decision that which microservices should actually respond to this request
- We can do message validation, response transformation, rate liming
- This API gateway will act as a middle end and will act as a reverse proxy
